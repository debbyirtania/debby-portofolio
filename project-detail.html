    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>This project maps where youth provision exists across England and identifies areas where youth need remains unmet. Because national datasets do not currently record the location of youth provision or its relationship to local need, a methodological framework was developed to create a clearer national picture.</p>

    <p>Using publicly available data from the Charity Commission and Companies House, youth-related organisations were identified through filtering assumptions and a consensus ranking approach, as youth provision is not explicitly labelled in the registers.</p>

    <p>Youth need was measured using the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) and Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) rates, which were combined into a Youth Need Index. Levels of provision were then compared against need to calculate an unmet youth need score at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level, enabling spatial analysis of disparity between need and provision.</p>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>20,000+ organisations</strong> were identified as likely providers of youth services, including charities and community interest companies.</li>
      <li><strong>77.5% of MSOAs</strong> have at least one youth-related organisation, while <strong>2.1%</strong> have no provision despite serving populations of over 1,000 young people.</li>
      <li>Urban areas such as <strong>Blackpool</strong> and <strong>Redcar & Cleveland</strong> show the highest levels of unmet youth need, combining high deprivation and high ASB rates with limited provision.</li>
      <li>Youth provision appears to align more strongly with <strong>Anti Social Behavior</strong> than deprivation, suggesting it responds more to social risk than structural disadvantage.</li>
    </ul>
